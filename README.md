* Create a notification banner after the caution phase 
* The risk level is indicated by alternating red and black background colors

## Benefit
* In the event of an accident, the location and situation of rescue victims can be identified after securing appropriate first aid supplies and emergency personnel

## Supplementary matters
* Realistically, it is not possible to recognize a large number of people
* Since a single camera cannot recognize the population density of a large area, efficiency and performance will improve if multiple areas are recognized using multiple cameras
